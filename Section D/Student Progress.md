Student Progress

The five lagging students and the ten students who are at risk are likely to be facing the same difficulties in 
terms of their academics; the five students who are lagging likely donâ€™t understand the content well, so each time the class moves to a new chapter of the course, that follows up 
from the previews chapter, they have first to go back and try to understand the previous chapter. Hence, they fall back as the class moves forward.

The ten students are likely to have the same issue, they struggle to grasp the content of the course as it is being taught, so they fall behind in trying to understand 
previous content that may be needed to complete the current tasks.

An intervention plan would be to get the 15 students as one group. I would give extra classes or lessons during free time; this will help both groups catch up with 
the course while ensuring they understand the content being taught.

The next thing would be to grant the ten students a few extra days to complete their tasks.
This will not negatively impact the five students who are ahead, as the additional lessons given to the 15 students will not be during official lesson times or periods.

An alternative would be to pair the five students ahead with the five behind (given that they are willing). Pairing each student with each student will a
llow students to learn from each other, which is a good way for students to understand concepts from different perspectives or sources and to build relationships and teamwork.
Suppose the five groups of students are paired; the remaining ten would receive extra lessons during our free time to help them better understand 
their tasks and the course content they did not understand.

This will ensure that the students ahead are not negatively affected while the students struggling receive extra help.
