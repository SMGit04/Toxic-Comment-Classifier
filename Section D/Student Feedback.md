Student Feedback

The first thing I would do in handling the issue is to notify my superiors about the incident and ask for their advice for managing it. 
I would then apologize to the student for not being able to provide feedback that offers value to them.

I would then issue a public or social media statement apologizing to the student and the organization, taking full responsibility for the situation.

I would then review my feedback and improve or provide another well-thought feedback to the student and ask the student for a meeting or consultation to further discuss the issue at hand and 
offer more feedback; after the second attempt, I would ask the student whether they are satisfied with the latest feedback.

If the student is still unsatisfied with the feedback provided, I would ask for a second opinion or ask a college or senior to assist me with my review 
and the student code and see where or how I can improve my method of giving feedback to students.

Following this, I would then identify whether I had an issue hindering me from providing good feedback and address the problem so that the same issue would not appear again.
